## Purpose of this blog

Welcome to my developer / engineering blog.  The purpose of this blog is to explore technology, tools and awesome stuff.  I hope to clear up different subjects here as I journey through the forest modern of technology and engineering.  

### How to read a post / design pattern

Normally the pattern of a post will be either a sort of "howto" get started with some technology or tool, or some kind of reflection over a conceptual thing in technology.  The aim is not to go too much into detail, but rather provide an outline for understanding.

Basically built upon my idea of how to fundamentally learn technology:
1. Get an overview of the subject and why it is important - **Analysis**
2. Learn what the characteristics of a technology is - **Deconstruction**
3. Repeat the 20% most important features of the technology - **Selection**
4. Reflect, explore variation and translate to your internal language - **Optimization**

A very common pattern in engineering is that theory and practise is quite different.  One can learn the conceptual parts of something, however when implementing the technologt one will find that it may be very different indeed. I believe the methodology for learning complex subjects if first get the general idea of the concept, and then understand the differences in implementation by actually implementing
