## Hello, world!

Thought it was about time I set up a personal blog on the many different projects and technologies I work with. I think engineering and technology is awesome, and there has been some curiousity around my activities and side projects, so I thought Id write a blog to share some of the insight of the things Ive learned on my journey through technology, great challenges and hopefully give you readers some guide to help you find your way through technology in this day and age yourself.

And its fun!

## $ jekyll serve

So I figured, as a developers blog, that github pages would be a great place to serve my blog. With Jekyll and git I can easily keep track of my blog and update new posts as inspiration hits me.

![Jekyll serve]({{ site.url }}/assets/jekyll_serve.png)

And its really quite simple to use, and just in general makes writing a static blog site awesome. A great tool

For my theme I found a simple minimalistic theme by by @itsbenjamin where I stripped out and modified the parts I liked to give a bit of my own style. Thanks Benj!

And of course, thanks to github and the developers of jekyll
