## Hello, world!

Thought it was about time I set up a blog. For those who don't know me: I am Anders and I think engineering, technology and learning about interesting topics is a fun way to spend a saturday afternoon - especially if i can materialize that knowledge into something useful. I am not going to deny that I find battery technology and software design patterns as interesting topics of discussion, and that I have at some point written a program to automate my user of Tinder.

I hope here to document my crazy adventure through technology as an engineer in the 21st century, so come along and join me!

## $ jekyll serve

In order to deliver this fantastic content I am using jekyll on github pages.

I figured, as a developers blog, that github pages would be a great place to serve my blog. With Jekyll and git I can easily keep track of my blog and update new posts as inspiration hits me.

Yay!

![Jekyll serve]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/jekyll_serve.png)

And its really quite simple to use, and just in general makes writing a static blog site awesome.

A great tool. The best. Fantastic.

So stay tuned, I have already lined up posts for the next months!
