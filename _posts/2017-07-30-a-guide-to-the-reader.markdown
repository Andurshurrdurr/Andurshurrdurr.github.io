## Purpose of this blog

This is my personal developer / engineering blog. As such, the utility of this blog is a tool for me to document different technologies as I work on them for myself, but also as a source of communication to others of what my capabilities are. I often find that I learn more when I write about what in this format, and its nice to have explanations from myself at a later time when I eventually forget details on the different subjects. The best teacher I can ever have is usually myself.

**However** I hope you, dear reader, will find some value in what I write as well, and therefore I am building my blog in (what I think of as) a well structured and logical way, with a as good and efficient explanations as possible.

### How to read a post / design pattern

The general structure of my blogposts will usually follow the same pattern:

- An introduction on the technology at a conceptual level to give a birds eye view of the subject in order to put it into context
- What the features of the technology or selected tool is
- Why the technology is useful / important / worth learning about
- Characteristics / conventions / indicators of proper use of the technology
- Example implementation by myself (example code or application)
- Comments and reflections by myself
- Reference to other sources

Basically built upon my idea of how to fundamentally learn technology:
1. Get an overview of the context and why you should learn the subject - **Analysis**
2. Learn what the characteristics of a technology is - **Deconstruction**
3. Repeat the 20% most important features of the technology - **Selection**
4. Reflect, explore variation and translate to your internal language - **Optimization**

### What will I be writing about

To keep structure to the blog, I am writing series about different subjects and technologies, where the first parts of the series will get into basics and later parts will increasingly focus on specifics. The different series can be found divided into groups under [categories]({{site.url}}/categories).

The different series/categories I aim to cover on this blog are as following:

- Software Engineering - Software architecture, Design patterns, SE tech
- Mechatronics engineering
- Web development
- Cloud / Sysadmin / Linux / Release Engineering
- Embedded systems and bare-metal programming
- Creating content - Blender & Kden Live
- Data-Science and Machine Learning
- Entrepreneurship / Marketing / Sales
- Technology in society / technology and philosophy

Over time I also aim to build up reference materials for engineering a development (and anything really) in pdf for download

If you like what I am writing about or developing, feel free to give me a star on github, subscribe to my youtube channel or like / follow me on twitter / facebook, and/or share my work so others can discover it aswell. If you would like a consultation on technology or join a coffee in Bergen feel free to contact me.
