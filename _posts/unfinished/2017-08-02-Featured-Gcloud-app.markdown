## Gcloud blog
Hello and welcome to this this featured post. My goal with these posts is just to reflect over these spikesolutions and featured works which I will occasionally post on this site.

In this application I am featuring the use of the google sdk, google app engine, and python to deploy an application on the google cloud infrastructure.

You can find the sourcecode for the application at [GitHub](https://github.com/Andurshurrdurr/gcloud) and a running demo at url. Below I am writing abit about what Challanges I faced during development and what Ive learned.

#### Technology
For this webapp I am basing myself on the following technologies
- Use of Python
- Google SDKs
- Google app engine and the gcloud platform

### Challanges

### Solutions
**First**
