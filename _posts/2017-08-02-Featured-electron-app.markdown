## Cornelly! My first electron app
Hello and welcome to this this featured post. My goal with these posts is just to reflect over these spikesolutions and featured works which I will occasionally post on this site.

In this application I am featuring the use of NodeJS with electron and JavaScript

You can find the sourcecode for the application at [GitHub](https://github.com/Andurshurrdurr/Cornelly). Below I am writing abit about what Challanges I faced during development and what Ive learned.

#### Technology
For this webapp I am basing myself on the following technologies
- Use of JavaScript and web technology
- Use of the electron framework for making a cross platform application
- Use of Knockout js and MVVM pattern
- NodeJS

### Challanges
**First**, using nodejs and electron to create desktop apps brings a new dimension to the JavaScript programming language

### Solutions
**First**
